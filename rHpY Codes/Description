1. Version 1 (rHpy_claude_script.py):
- Basic implementation that preserves residue order using string dtype for Residue_number
- Single output file per input file with all chains combined
- Uses standard pandas groupby with reset_index()

2. Version 2 (rHpy_claude_script_2.py):
- Very similar to Version 1
- Main difference is the output directory name ("Mean_rHPy_values_2" instead of "Mean_rHPy_values")
- Otherwise functionally identical to Version 1

3. Version 3 (PDB rHPy Mean Calculator with Preserved Order and Chain Separation.py):
Most advanced version with several key improvements:
- Processes each chain separately using a chain-by-chain approach
- Creates separate output files for each chain (filename includes chain identifier)
- Better order preservation by:
  - Using ordered_residues specific to each chain
  - Merging with chain-specific results
  - Maintaining explicit column order throughout
- Saves results in "Mean_rHPy_values_3" directory
- More organized error handling and progress reporting per chain

The main evolution across these scripts is:
- V1 → V2: Minimal changes (mainly directory naming)
- V2 → V3: Major improvements in chain handling and organization
